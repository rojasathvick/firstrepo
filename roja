23. How would you recover a branch that has already pushed changes in the central repository but has been accidentally deleted from every team member’s local machines?
We can recover this by checking out the latest commit of this branch in the reflog and then checking it out as a new branch.

24. Can you tell something about git reflog?
This command tracks every single change made in the repository references (that can be branches or tags) and also maintains the branches/tags log history that was either created locally or checked out. Reference logs such as the commit snapshot of when the branch was created or cloned, checked-out, renamed, or any commits made on the branch are maintained by Git and listed by the ‘reflog’ command.
